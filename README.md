# Fine Tuning AI Models

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning AI models using the `transformers` library. The notebook demonstrates how to perform text classification using a pre-trained model and a small dataset.

## Contents

- **Install Required Libraries**: Instructions to install necessary libraries.
- **Load Pre-trained Model**: Steps to load a pre-trained model for sequence classification.
- **Load a Small Dataset**: Instructions to load and preprocess a small dataset for training and testing.
- **Preprocess the Data**: Code to preprocess the dataset for model training.
- **Train the Model**: Steps to train the model using the preprocessed dataset.
- **Evaluate the Model**: Instructions to evaluate the trained model.
- **Use the Model to Predict Sentiment**: Code to use the trained model for sentiment prediction on new text inputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `transformers` library
- `datasets` library
- `tensorflow` or `torch` library
